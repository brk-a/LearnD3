Resolve locally all dependencies loaded through fully qualified CDN urls.


### Supported CDNs

Following the list of supported CDNs (so far).

  * [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/#/)
  * [rawgit.com](https://rawgit.com) (both dev and prod links)


### Example

If your module has [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML) as dependency,
and you have installed it locally,
you can import it as fully qualified ESM module.

The remote url will be resolved through the locally installed dependency.

```js
import hyper from 'https://unpkg.com/hyperhtml@latest/esm/index.js';

hyper(document.body)`
  <h1>Hello ESM</h1>`;
```

This enables your modules to be natively testable/usable as ESM in browsers, but also easily bundled for production.


### Installation
```
$ npm install rollup-plugin-cdn
```


### Usage
```javascript
// rollup.config.js
import cdn from 'rollup-plugin-cdn';

export default {
  input: './esm/index.js',
  plugins: [cdn()],
};
```
